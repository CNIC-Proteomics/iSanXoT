# iSanXoT Installation

## Windows distribution

<!-- ### Requirements for Windows distribution

iSanXoT uses Windows Python packages which needs via the SDK to build code. Thus, Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required. On Linux and Mac, the C++ libraries are installed with the compiler.

Get the "Microsoft C++ Build Tools" by one of these choices:

- from an offline installer: [vs_BuildTools.exe](env/vs_BuildTools.exe) (Recommended).
- from [Microsoft Build Tools for Visual Studio] (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16)

When the Microsoft Build Tools is opened, select:

    Workloads → Desktop development with C++
    
Then for Individual Components select only:

    - Windows 10 SDK
    - C++ x64/x86 build tools (MSVC - VS)
