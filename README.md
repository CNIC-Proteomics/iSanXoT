# iSanXoT

The iSanXoT software application is a bioinformatics resource developed in the Cardiovascular Proteomics Laboratory at Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC). Conceived as an integrated tool, iSanXoT is aimed at the statistical, quantitative analysis of proteomics experiments based on the weighted spectrum, peptide and protein (WSPP) model and the systems biology triangle (SBT) approach. The outcome is a precise quantitation of not only protein abundance changes, but also alterations to protein function.

# Installation

## Download 
Clone or download the distribution from https://github.com/CNIC-Proteomics/iSanXoT repository

## Execute the install script

### Windows distribution
```
Execute the batch script "install_win64.bat"
```

> **_NOTE:_** Requirements Microsoft Visual Studio but with the C++ languange!!!
>Windows Python needs Visual C++ libraries installed via the SDK to build code, such as via setuptools.extension.Extension or numpy.distutils.core.Extension. For example, building f2py modules in Windows with Python requires Visual C++ SDK as installed above. On Linux and Mac, the C++ libraries are installed with the compiler.
