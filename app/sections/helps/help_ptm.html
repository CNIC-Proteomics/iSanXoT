    <h2><a class="anchor" href="#help_ptm"></a>PTM Workflow</h2>
<p><i>The PTM Workflow</i> is intended for the statistical analysis of multiplexed, high-throughput proteomics experiments where one or more post-translational modifications (PTMs) are to be considered.
    As is the case for the Basic Workflow, the PTM workflow includes validation of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) through pRatio, 
    calculation of isotope channel ratios and statistical assessment of alterations to peptide, protein and functional category abundance based on the weighted spectrum, peptide and protein (WSPP) model 
    and the systems biology triangle (SBT) approach.
    In addition, the calculation of variance along the different integrations is carried out considering only the non-posttranslationally modified peptides pointed out by the user.
    Then the posttranslationally modified peptides are quantitated using the so-obtained variance.</p>
