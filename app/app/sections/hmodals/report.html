            This module creates tabular tables (tsv) called 'Report Tables' (RPT) containing the desired quantitative results of an integration from several samples. The user can choose to tabulate either Xl or Vl from the lower level, Xu or Vu from the upper level and n, Z or FDR from the integration.<br/>'Merge Report Table' allows to join an existing Report Table, which must contain at least one of the integration levels.
            </p>
            <p><blockquote>Note: always merge using as a reference at least one of the lower levels of the report tables; do not join report tables matching their upper levels.</blockquote>'Merge Relation Table' allows to join an existing tsv table, which must contain a column header matching one of the integration levels <blockquote>Tip: Relation Tables can be merged to attach additional information or to join Report Tables with different levels.</blockquote>

            <h5>Simple parameters</h5>
            <p>The parameters/columns of this module are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Forced execution: checkbox that determines to force the execution or not.</li>
              <li>Sample folder(s): indicates the names of the folders where the statistical data for each integration is located.</li>
              <li>Lower level: indicates the starting level (peptide, protein, category) for the integration whose data are to be reported.</li>
              <li>Higher level: indicates the ending level for the integration whose data are to be reported.</li>
              <li>Reported vars: specifies which statistical variables will be reported. The available variables are “n”, “tags”, “Z”, “FDR”, “Xsup”, “Vsup”, “Xinf”, “Vinf”.</li>
              <li>Output report: is the report filename (without extension).</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Advanced parameters</h5>
            <p>This module accepts advanced parameters:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Level names to show: if you don’t want to show one of the level data in the report. By default, all the levels are shown.</li>
              <li>Merge with report: Join with designates the file whose Reported vars will be incorporated into Output after intersection with the latter file.</li>
              <li>Add columns from relation table: insert into the current report the columns from the relation table (RT) at the end. The RT columns are added based on the values of the “lower level”. It is possible to use multiple RT separated by comma.</li>
              <li>Filter: the data of report could be filtered based on the reported variables (n, Z, FDR, etc). For more detail read “Filter” in “Special Parameters” section.</li>
            </ul>
