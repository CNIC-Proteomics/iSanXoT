    <h2><a class="anchor" href="#help_wf-lblfree"></a>Label-Free Workflow</h2>
<p><i>The Label-Free Workflow</i> is intended for the statistical analysis of label-free, high-throughput proteomics experiments.
    This workflow includes validation of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) through pRatio and statistical assessment of alterations to peptide, 
    protein and functional category abundance based on the weighted spectrum, peptide and protein (WSPP) model and the systems biology triangle (SBT) approach.</p>
