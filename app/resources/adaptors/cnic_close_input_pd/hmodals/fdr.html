            <p>iSanXoT relies on the probability ratio (pRatio) method, an algorithm that calculates the probability of random peptide matching and provides the corresponding FDR for peptide identification. The FDR parameters displays the following fields:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Forced execution: checkbox that determines to force the execution or not.</li>
              <li>Experiment: the aforementioned experiment allocation.</li>
              <li>Threshold (ppm): is the postscoring mass filtering cut-off to be applied after using wide mass windows in the database search, as was the case with these sample data. Threshold is actually equivalent to the relative deviation experimentally observed for precursor ions in a particular LC-MS/MS run.</li>
              <li>Isotopologue recovery: allows pRatio to recover precursor m/z values matching some 13C isotopologue when using wide mass windows in the LC-MS/MS acquisition that otherwise would remain unnoticed. For that, it must be indicated whether precursor m/z values should be tracked only around their experimental m/z (value = 1) or also ± 1 Th (value = 3) and ± 2 Th (value = 5, the one used here) away.</li>
              <li>FDR cutoff: establishes the FDR cut-off for PSM validation. The value used here (0.01, i.e. 1% FDR) implies that one in every 100 validated PSMs is incorrect.</li>
              <li>Score: determines the score used to calculate the FDR. These scores are “XCorr” (SEQUEST5 cross correlation score), “cXCorr” (the corrected XCorr), or "hypersocre" (from MSFragger) will be used by pRatio for FDR calculation.</li>
              <li>Decoy label: is the tag attached to decoy protein identifiers in the concatenated protein database previously used for peptide identification.</li>
            </ul>
